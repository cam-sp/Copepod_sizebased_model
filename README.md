# Copepod_sizebased_model
Here you can find the MATLAB codes used to run the generic traitbased model of copepod communities.
The whole code can be run from the file "main_script.m".
The codes to re-create the figures of the manuscript have been uploaded, but the files containing the workspace of the exact runs for the paper are too large to be uploaded here. They can be requested by sending me an email: mcsp@aqua.dtu.dk

A user-friendly code can be expected soon. 

For the time being ere are the raw files used to run the model up until now.
Main files to consider:
    "main_script.m" --> file from where to run the whole code
    "parameters_copepod_model.m" --> file where you can change any parameter
    "code_plot_spec_diagnostics_paper" --> code to make figure 5
    "code_rest_of_figures" --> code figures 3 and 4 and the R* in appendix
    "code_figures_seasonal" --> code figures related to seasonal scenario (fig 7 and others)
    "code_figure_paramsweep" --> code figure 6.
