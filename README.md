# Copepod_sizebased_model
Here you can find the MATLAB codes used to run the generic traitbased model of copepod communities.
The whole code be run from the file "main_script.m".
The codes to re-create the figures have been uploaded, but the files containing the workspace of the exact runs for the paper are too large to be uploaded here. They can be requested by sending me an email: mcsp@aqua.dtu.dk

A user-friendly code can be expected soon. For the time being ere are the raw files used to run the model up until now.
