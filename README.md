# Copepod_sizebased_model
Here you can find the MATLAB codes used in the paper "A generic size- and trait-based model of plankton communities" 2020 
There numerical simulations (and corresponding figures in the paper) can be found in:
    -"z_main.m" runs the constant environment scenario.
    -"z_main_seasonal.m" runs the seasonal environment scenario.
    Both use the same function to solve the ode system--> "z_ode_copepod_model.m"
The figures with the analytical solutions are all in "z_code_rest_of_figures.m"
The rest of files here attached are needed to reproduce the figures, but do not need tobe touched.
The data in the file "data_development_times.xlsx" were extracted from the appendix 3 in "Kiorboe, T., & Sabatini, M. (1995). Scaling of fecundity, growth and development in marine planktonic copepods. Marine ecology progress series. Oldendorf, 120(1), 285-298." and the feeding modes were defined by using the datset of "Brun, P. G., Payne, M., & Ki√∏rboe, T. (2017). A trait database for marine copepods. Earth System Science Data, 9(1), 99-113."
